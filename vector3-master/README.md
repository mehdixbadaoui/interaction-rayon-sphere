# Vector3 â€“ SIMD 3D-vector C++ implementation

This is a simple C++ library implementing a mathematical 3D-vector class using
[SIMD](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/SIMD) instructions. It based on [this
version](http://fastcpp.blogspot.fr/2011/12/simple-vector3-class-with-sse-support.html).

## Example

**test.cpp**
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "vector3.h"

int main() {
    Vector3 a(1, 1, 1);
    Vector3 b(2, 0, -1);

    std::cout << "a:\t" << a << std::endl
              << "b:\t" << b << std::endl
              << "a.x:\t" << a.x << std::endl
              << "add:\t" << a + b << std::endl
              << "sub:\t" << a - b << std::endl
              << "dot:\t" << a.dot(b) << std::endl
              << "smult:\t" << 2 * b << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**compile**
```bash
c++ -o test test.cpp vector3.cpp -msse4
```

**outuput**
```
a:	Vector3(1, 1, 1)
b:	Vector3(2, 0, -1)
a.x:	1
add:	Vector3(3, 1, 0)
sub:	Vector3(-1, 1, 2)
dot:	1
smult:	Vector3(4, 0, -2)
```

## Supported operations

The provided class name is Vector3. All values are in floating-point precision.

* Element-wise addition
* Element-wise subtraction
* Element-wise multiplication
* Element-wise division
* Scalar addition
* Scalar subtraction
* Scalar multiplication
* Scalar division
* Dot product
* Normalization
* Norm computing
* Equality testing

The exhaustive list is available [vector3.h](vector3.h).

## Compiler flags

You need to enable SSE2, SEE3 and SSE4 instructions on your compiler. GCC
/ Clang use `-msse4` to enable the needed instruction sets.


## Compatibility notes

* This version uses SSE4 instructions and is not meant to be backward
  compatible.
* It is supposed to work on Linux, OS X and Windows, although it has not been
  extensively tested on every operating system.
